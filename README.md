# Python Pizza Deliveries

This Python program simulates a simple pizza ordering system. The user can choose a pizza size (Small, Medium, or Large), decide if they want extra toppings such as pepperoni and extra cheese, and the program will calculate the total price based on the choices.

## Features:
- Choose from Small, Medium, or Large pizza sizes.
- Add optional toppings: Pepperoni and Extra Cheese.
- The total bill is calculated and displayed.

## How it works:
1. The user is asked to select a pizza size.
2. The program calculates the base price for the selected size.
3. The user can then choose to add pepperoni and extra cheese, each with additional costs.
4. The final bill is displayed at the end of the order.
